# Lending Protocol

## Project Description

The Lending Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contract that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency assets in a trustless manner. Built on the Core Blockchain, this protocol allows lenders to deposit funds and earn interest while borrowers can access liquidity by providing collateral that exceeds the loan value. The system implements an over-collateralized lending model to ensure the security of lenders' funds.

## Project Vision!


Our vision is to create an accessible, transparent, and secure lending platform that democratizes access to financial services. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate traditional banking intermediaries, reduce costs, and provide global access to lending and borrowing services. The protocol is designed to be community-driven, with the potential for governance token integration in future iterations.

## Key Features

- **Collateralized Lending**: Borrowers must provide 150% collateral value to ensure loan security
- **Interest-Bearing Deposits**: Lenders earn 5% annual interest on their deposited funds  
- **Instant Liquidity**: Borrowers can access funds immediately upon providing sufficient collateral
- **Transparent Interest Calculation**: Interest is calculated based on time elapsed and displayed transparently
- **Flexible Repayment**: Borrowers can repay loans at any time to retrieve their collateral
- **Secure Withdrawals**: Lenders can withdraw their deposits when sufficient liquidity is available
- **Real-time Loan Tracking**: Users can query loan details and status at any time

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Asset Support**: Expand beyond ETH to support various ERC-20 tokens
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Implement supply and demand-based interest rate models
- **Liquidation Mechanism**: Add automated liquidation for under-collateralized loans
- **Governance Integration**: Deploy governance tokens for community-driven protocol updates
- **Flash Loans**: Introduce uncollateralized loans for advanced DeFi strategies
- **Insurance Pool**: Create a safety fund to protect against smart contract risks
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Expand to multiple blockchain networks
- **Credit Scoring**: Implement reputation-based lending for reduced collateral requirements
